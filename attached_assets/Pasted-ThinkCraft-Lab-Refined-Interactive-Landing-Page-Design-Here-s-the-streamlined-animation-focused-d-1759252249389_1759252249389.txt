ThinkCraft Lab - Refined Interactive Landing Page Design
Here's the streamlined, animation-focused design based on your specifications:

PRELOADER (Full screen, 2-3 seconds)

Solid orange background (#FF6B00)
"ThinkCraft" in large white bold typography, centered
Simple fade in of the text
Optional: Subtle loading bar beneath (white, thin line)
Smooth fade to white as it transitions to main page


NAVIGATION (Floating, Minimalist)

Thin horizontal bar floating at top with slight margin
Semi-transparent white background with blur
Logo on left (small, compact)
Links on right: Home | Shop | Work | About Us | Contact
Very minimal, clean typography
Links have subtle orange underline on hover
Disappears on scroll down, reappears on scroll up


HERO SECTION (Full viewport, Bold Typographic)
Editorial/Swiss Typography Style:
        TRANSFORMING IDEAS

              INTO REALITY

    THROUGH INNOVATIVE

         DESIGN & 3D PRINTING

Large, bold sans-serif typography (think Helvetica, Swiss style)
Black text on white background
Asymmetric layout - lines are deliberately off-center
Maximum font size (like 80-120px)
Clean, lots of white space

Scroll Animation Behavior:

Line 1 ("TRANSFORMING IDEAS") → slides RIGHT and fades out
Line 2 ("INTO REALITY") → slides LEFT and fades out
Line 3 ("THROUGH INNOVATIVE") → slides RIGHT and fades out
Line 4 ("DESIGN & 3D PRINTING") → slides LEFT and fades out
Alternating pattern based on index (even=right, odd=left)

Small subtext beneath:

"Scroll to explore" in small, light gray text
Down arrow that animates


TRANSITION MOMENT #1 (Color Inversion)
As you scroll past hero section:

Background fades from WHITE → ORANGE
Text color fades from BLACK/DARK → WHITE
Smooth transition over ~200px of scroll
Everything inverts


WORK SHOWCASE SECTION (Orange background, white text)
Heading at top:
ASK YOURSELF — WHAT IF YOU COULD:

Large white typography
Centered or left-aligned

Interactive Carousel:

Horizontal scrollable cards (or arrow navigation)
Each card shows one benefit:

"Prototype products in days, not months"
"Reduce manufacturing costs by 40%"
"Unlock limitless design possibilities"
"Transform complex ideas into tangible objects"
"Iterate designs without expensive tooling"


Card Design:

Large card (like 600px wide)
White text on slightly darker orange background
Minimal, clean design
Number in corner (01, 02, 03...)
Simple icon or small image if needed


Navigation:

Left/right arrows on sides
Or drag to scroll horizontally
Smooth transitions between cards
Dots indicator showing which card you're on



Featured Work Grid Below:

3-4 project thumbnails in grid
Each shows:

Project image
Category tag
Brief title


Hover effect: Image zooms slightly, orange overlay appears

SCROLL-TRIGGERED TEXT REVEAL (Still orange background)

Large text (like 32-40px)
White text initially at 50% opacity (gray-ish white)
As you scroll through this section:

Words/phrases highlight to 100% white progressively
Maybe add subtle orange underline to highlighted text
Creates reading rhythm as you scroll


Each sentence or phrase highlights as it reaches center of viewport


STAGGERED TEXT ANIMATION SECTION (Still orange)
Scroll-driven parallax word animation:
Words appear one at a time as you scroll, sliding in from alternating directions:

"EXPECT" → slides in from LEFT to RIGHT
"BRAVE" → slides in from RIGHT to LEFT (overlaps with EXPECT)
"INNOVATIVE" → slides in from LEFT to RIGHT (EXPECT starts fading)
"SOLUTIONS" → slides in from RIGHT to LEFT (BRAVE fading)
"DESIGNED" → slides in from LEFT to RIGHT
"FOR YOU" → slides in from RIGHT to LEFT

Visual behavior:

Large bold words (like 120px+)
White text
Semi-transparent as they move
Creates dynamic, flowing effect
Overlapping motion
Scroll controls the timeline (not auto-play)
Words fade out as new ones enter

Technical approach:

GSAP ScrollTrigger
Staggered timeline animation
Scrub linked to scroll position


TRANSITION MOMENT #2 (Color Restoration)
After the staggered text section:

Background fades from ORANGE → WHITE
Text fades from WHITE → BLACK/DARK
Smooth transition back to original colors
~200px scroll distance

Overall Animation Philosophy:

Smooth and purposeful - every animation serves the narrative
Performance optimized - 60fps on all devices
Scroll-driven storytelling - user controls the pace
Color transitions create distinct sections
Typography-focused - minimal imagery, maximum impact
Professional yet bold - Swiss minimalism meets modern web

Color Journey:

White → Orange → White (creates visual chapters)
Preloader is orange to white (warm welcome)
Strategic inversions keep things dynamic

This design is content-light, animation-heavy as requested, letting the interactions tell ThinkCraft's story.
